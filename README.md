In optical pumping, circularly polarised photons selec-tively filtered from linearly polarised lightπ,π=1√2[σ+±σ−](1)redistribute the electronic states of a sample of rubid-ium  atoms.   (σ+represents  right-hand  circularly  po-larised light andσ−represents left-hand circularly po-larised  light).   Free  rubidium  atoms  are  modelled  asa  simple  hydrogenic  system  with  only  the  single  va-lence electron investigated.  This polarisation imposesa  selection  rule  on  the  system,  therefore  providing  aconstraint on the possible electronic transitions.In quantum computing, a qubit, the basic unit ofquantum information, is described as a coherent super-position  of  two  quantum  states,  labelled|0〉and|1〉.[1].  Quantum operations on qubits, i.e.  quantum logicgates, form the basis of quantum circuits where initial-ising the system of qubits is equivalent to identifyingthe initial state of each qubit.In particular, we hypothesise the selection rules de-fined by the polarisation of light may be used in opticalpumping  to  quench  our  system  to  a  higher  energeticstate,|0〉or a lower energetic state|1〉, therefore com-pletely determining the initial state of the system. Quantum  Supremacy,  the  hypothesis  that  quan-tum processors execute algorithms at an exponentiallyfaster  rate  compared  to  classical  processors  has  beensupported  by  experimental  evidence  by  Google  [2].Quantum  algorithms  offer  a  more  than  polynomialcomplexity advantage over the most optimal classicalalgorithms including simulations in solid state physics[3], approximation of Jones polynomials [4], and solv-ing Pell’s equation [5].It is therefore crucial that further experiments arecarried  out  to  investigate  feasible  regimes  in  which quantum  logic  gates  can  be  simulated.In  opticalpumping we demonstrate that for a short timescale thecloud of rubidium gas can be modelled as a collectionof qubits with well-posed initial conditions.
